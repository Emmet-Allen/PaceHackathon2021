Prompt: As part of a NYC real estate data science team you want to help sellers understand what they should sell their homes for, 
as well as inform them of the most important attributes of a home which influence the price. Youâ€™d like to be able to provide guidance on how real estate agents and the
home sellers can frame their home descriptions on Zillow in order to ensure their home will be competitive in the market.
